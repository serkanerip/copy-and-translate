## What does this application do ? 
This application is doing fast translation with keyboard shortcuts.
## Which os do you support ? 
Just only linux, windows and mac os is coming soon.
## How does it work ?
This app gets current copied text from the system clipboard and then translates the text via yandex-api and shows translation like a notification.Immediately after translation, clipboard (original text) value is changed with translated text so you can do control + V to paste it. By using this application you do not need to open new web pages and copy paste around.
